# Portfolio for web developer

## Description

A Web Development Portfolio can showcase candidate skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights candidates' strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Applying the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
